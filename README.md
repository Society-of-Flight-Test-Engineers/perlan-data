# perlan-data

A fork of the Perlan science data available at <http://www.perlanproject.cloud/data/>

The [Perlan Project](http://www.perlanproject.org/) has made ~3GB of data available for open source science.

The [Society of Flight Test Engineers](https://www.sfte.org) is interested in using this dataset to drive investigations in the use of modern data science workflows as applied to flight test data.

Desired outcomes for this dataset:

1. Make Perlan data available
1. Make Perlan data understandable
1. Make Perlan data interactive

This is a living project, and ideas can be added to the [repository project tracker](https://github.com/Society-of-Flight-Test-Engineers/perlan-data/projects/).

We look forward to your thoughts and participation!
