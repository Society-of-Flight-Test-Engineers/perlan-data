This is the baloon sounding data from El Calafate. 

There are 2 directories:
	1. The "Raw" directory contains the raw data produced by the iMet software
	2. The "Graphs" directory contains the graphs produced by the iMet software

Each sounding is saved as:
	1. MM_DD_YYYY for the raw data
	2. MM_DD_YYYY_Graphs for the for the graphs 

Occasionally the connection can be lost with the balloon part way through the flight. 
In that case, there are 2 or more sounding files for the launch. 
Their nomenclature follows MM_DD_YYYY, MM_DD_YYYY_2, MM_DD_YYYY_3 etc...
